# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in
this repository.

## What this crate is

`bup` ("Bitcoin user policy") is a single-crate Rust library that models Bitcoin
spending policies on top of `rust-miniscript` (`miniscript = "12.0"`). It is
descriptor-agnostic at the API surface but compiles **exclusively to Taproot
multipath descriptors** and round-trips back from them via `Policy::from_descriptor`.

The model was extracted from `liana/`'s descriptor analysis so that `bup` stays
independent of the rest of the Liana stack. License is BSD 3-Clause; copyright held
by "The Liana developers".

Rust edition is `2024` - features like `let chains` and updated closure capture rules
are available.

## Build / test

Standard cargo workflow; no `just` or task runner.

- `cargo build`
- `cargo test` - full test suite (~100 unit tests, all in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`
  inside source files; there's no `tests/` directory)
- `cargo test <name>` - run a single test by substring (e.g.
  `cargo test sanitize_rejects_two_primaries`)
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- `cargo fmt -- --check`

`Cargo.lock` is gitignored - this is a library, not a binary.

## Architecture

The public model is **`Policy` → `Vec<Path>` → `(Semantic, Locktime, TapPosition)`**.
A `Policy` either is constructed from typed `Path`s (`Policy::new`) and then compiled
(`Policy::compile`) into a Tr multipath descriptor, or is parsed back from such a
descriptor (`Policy::from_descriptor`). Round-tripping is a load-bearing invariant.

### Module map (`src/`)

- **`lib.rs`** - re-exports the public surface. The crate's docs live in `policy.rs`
  / `path.rs`.
- **`path.rs`** - `Path`, `Semantic`, `Locktime`, `OXpub`, `TapPosition`, `Leaf`.
  Defines the per-spending-path data model and its structural validation
  (`validate()` methods). Also defines two grid constants: `CLTV_ALIGNMENT = 1024`
  (~1 week of blocks; renewable CLTV heights must be a non-zero multiple) and
  `MULTIPATH_SEMANTIC_FACTOR = 512` (each path role lives within a
  `[start, start + 512)` zone in the multipath index space).
- **`policy.rs`** - `Policy`, `PolicyType`, `PolicyError`. Holds `from_descriptor`
  (parser orchestration) and `compile` (compiler orchestration), plus `sanitize()` -
  the single source of truth for compile-readiness. `auto_promote_internal_key_maybe`
  lifts an eligible single-key, locktime-free path to the Tr internal key before
  compile; otherwise the deterministic NUMS unspendable key is used. Largest file
  (~1700 lines), and contains the bulk of the integration tests.
- **`compile.rs`** - helpers for `Policy::compile`. Converts `Semantic` / `Locktime`
  into `miniscript::policy::Concrete`, allocates fresh multipath derivation indices
  via a cursor, and handles m-of-n splitting (`split_m_of_n`).
- **`parse.rs`** - helpers for `Policy::from_descriptor`. Classifies a group of
  tap-tree leaves into a `Semantic` shape, infers `PolicyType`, computes per-path
  satisfaction weights.
- **`tree_builder.rs`** - generic tap-tree builder. `SubTree<T>` is created with a
  fixed slot layout (each slot has its absolute tap-tree depth pre-decided) and slots
  are mutated from `Free` → `Leaf` / `Link` as paths are placed and as padding fills
  the rest. DFS iteration is just a `Vec` walk.
- **`multipath.rs`** - reads the `<a;b>` group out of a Liana descriptor key, groups
  tap-tree leaves by their multipath index, and defines
  `NUMS_MARKER_MULTIPATH = [0x7FFF_FFFE, 0x7FFF_FFFF]` - the two largest unhardened
  indices, used as a marker on the NUMS internal key the compiler emits so the parser
  can recognise it cheaply (without recomputing the chain-code hash). The legacy
  chain-code recompute path still works in parallel. Exposes two public helpers:
  `get_multipath_index` (strict - single index, parser-internal contract: even start,
  consecutive `<a; a+1>`) and `key_indices` (returns every index a `MultiXPub` or
  `XPub` key claims, used by the compile-side collision check; enforces single-step,
  unhardened, and `<a; a+1>` consecutive shape but permits any starting parity).
- **`nums.rs`** - the BIP-341 NUMS ("Nothing Up My Sleeve") public key and
  `unspendable_internal_key` (the deterministic NUMS xpub derivation used as Tr
  internal key when no path qualifies for key-path spending). Pulled out of liana's
  `descriptors::analysis` so this crate stays independent.

### Conceptual invariants

These are enforced by `Policy::sanitize` / `validate_paths_for_type` and should be
respected when adding new path shapes or policy types:

- A `Policy` mixes **only one locktime flavor**: relative (`older`),
  aligned-renewable absolute (`after`, multiple of `CLTV_ALIGNMENT`), or
  foreign-unaligned absolute. Mixing flavors is `PolicyError::MixedTimelockKinds`.
- The Tr internal key path is **always** `Semantic::Single` and `Locktime::None`. If
  no such path exists, the internal key falls back to the deterministic NUMS
  unspendable.
- `MultiMandatory.threshold` must be in
  `[mandatory_count + 1, mandatory_count + cosigner_count]` - every leaf requires all
  mandatory keys plus at least one cosigner.
- `MultiMandatoryNested` thresholds must each be a proper subset selector
  (`1 <= threshold < key_count`) on both sides. Per-class frequencies
  (`mandatory_threshold * cosigner_count` vs `threshold * mandatory_count`) must
  differ - equal frequencies collapse the partition into something the parser can't
  recover. Canonical form requires the mandatory class to be the lower-frequency one
  (`mt * n < t * m`); swap the two key sets to canonicalise.
- `AbsoluteRenewable` heights must be on the block-height side of
  `LOCK_TIME_THRESHOLD` and aligned to `CLTV_ALIGNMENT`. "Renewable" means the
  descriptor can be re-issued at a later aligned height while remaining
  brute-forceable from the seed.
- `OXpub` rejects three sentinel/placeholder shapes: BIP-341 NUMS pubkey, zeroed
  x-coordinate, zeroed chain code. Real signer keys must pass `OXpub::validate`.
- **No `(xpub, multipath-index)` pair may be claimed by two distinct paths.**
  Enforced at compile time by `check_multipath_uniqueness` (run inside
  `Policy::compile` immediately after `assign_start_indices`) and raised as
  `PolicyError::DuplicateMultipathIndex { xpub, index }`. Catches `Custom`-vs-typed
  and `Custom`-vs-`Custom` overlaps at the individual-index level - so `<3;4>`
  collides with `<4;5>` on index `4`. The same error variant catches the degenerate
  within-key case `<n;n>` (two legs collapse onto one derivation). Non-consecutive
  multipath legs like `<3;5>` are rejected earlier by `key_indices` with
  `MultipathError::NonConsecutive`.

### Multipath index layout

`Semantic::starting_index(&Locktime)` assigns each (semantic, locktime) pair a base
multipath index:

| Locktime / Semantic                    | base index |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `None` + `Single`/`Multi`              | `512 * 1`  |
| `Relative` + `Single`/`Multi`          | `512 * 2`  |
| `Relative` + `MultiMandatory`          | `512 * 3`  |
| `AbsoluteRenewable` + `Single`/`Multi` | `512 * 4`  |
| `Absolute` + `Single`/`Multi`          | `512 * 5`  |
| `None` + `Custom`                      | `512 * 6`  |
| `AbsoluteRenewable` + `MultiMandatory` | `512 * 7`  |
| `Absolute` + `MultiMandatory`          | `512 * 8`  |
| `Relative` + `MultiMandatoryNested`    | `512 * 9`  |

The NUMS internal key is tagged with `[0x7FFF_FFFE, 0x7FFF_FFFF]`
(`NUMS_MARKER_MULTIPATH`).

### `PolicyType` variants

Inferred by `parse::infer_policy_type`; declared up-front for `Policy::new`:

- `Csv` - relative timelock recovery (legacy Liana shape).
- `Cltv` - absolute (height-based) timelock recovery, aligned to `CLTV_ALIGNMENT`.
- `CsvWithMandatoryKey` - `Csv` plus at least one `MultiMandatory` path.
- `CsvWithNestedMandatory` - `Csv` plus at least one `MultiMandatoryNested` path.
  Mixing `MultiMandatory` and `MultiMandatoryNested` in the same policy is `Unknown`
  (distinct typed homes).
- `Unknown` - descriptor / path set the typed classifier can't fold into the variants
  above. `PolicyType::Unknown` is constructable via `Policy::new` and skips
  policy-level invariants (primary count, recovery presence, mixing). It does NOT
  accept `Semantic::Unknown` paths - those are parser-only. Consumers who need an
  arbitrary tap-leaf script use
  `Semantic::Custom(Miniscript<DescriptorPublicKey, Tap>)`, which the compiler emits
  verbatim - multipath indices on the consumer's keys are the consumer's
  responsibility. `Custom` paths require `Locktime::None`; encode any locktime gate
  inside the embedded miniscript.
- `Invalid` - parser-only verdict; not constructable via `Policy::new`. Returned by
  `infer_policy_type` for path sets that can never be a valid policy (no recovery,
  mixed locktime flavors).

## Conventions when modifying this crate

- `Policy::sanitize` is non-mutating and is the canonical compile-readiness check.
  New invariants belong here, not duplicated inside `compile`. `compile` calls
  `sanitize` first and then trusts every invariant established by it.
- `auto_promote_internal_key_maybe` runs **before** `sanitize` inside `compile`, but
  `sanitize` itself stays non-mutating - don't introduce side-effecting validation.
- Round-trip is a hard guarantee for typed `Policy`s and for `Semantic::Custom`: any
  compiler change must keep `Policy::from_descriptor(policy.compile()?)` semantically
  equal to the input for those shapes. The test suite in `policy.rs` exercises this
  aggressively. The exception is `Semantic::Unknown` paths produced by the parser
  when classification fails - those are deliberately uncompilable
  (`PolicyError::UnknownNotConstructable` / `InconsistentPathsForType(Unknown)`).
  Consumers who need to reissue a descriptor that originally classified as `Unknown`
  must rebuild it themselves using `Semantic::Custom` with the raw miniscript.
- NUMS detection has two paths (marker check + legacy chain-code recompute) on
  purpose - keep both working so descriptors emitted by older code still parse.
- The crate intentionally has no dev-dependencies and no `tests/` integration suite;
  tests live next to the code they cover.
